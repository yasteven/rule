In order of resonability:
1) You should be able to pick which side of the court you start your first service point each game you serve.
2) You should be allowed to use two rackets.
3) You should win the game if an opponent's racket contacts you.
4) You should be allowed to cross the plane of the net to hit the ball.  
5) You should be allowed to throw your racket at the ball. 

Bonus: drop the scoring system for a points system but then have e.g., aces and clean winners +2, everthing else +1 and/or like, hitting permiter lines are +3, service lines are +2 on serve , or maybe even put specific regions .   

1 is obvious
2 is not disallowed in the rules of tennis. If it is more advantageous to use two rackets, then it is more advantageous to one racket ambidextrously. I don't see many tennis players palying ambidextrously.
3 makes the rest of the rules reasonable
4 still cannot touch the net - 3 means an opponent could touch your racket and win if you cross too close while they are at the net. even if you're on your side they could try to reach across - creating a virtual kitchen.  
5 still cannot touch the net - 3 means if it crosses the net the opponent grabs the racket and wins the game
